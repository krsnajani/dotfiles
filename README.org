I run a fairly simple system, primarily focused around Emacs and the terminal workflow. Most of these programs are command-line. Feel free to take what works. I don't intend for these to work on other systems, as long as they are operable on mine, I am content :)

** List of Programs
- Sway, Hyprland = Used interchangeably as the prefered window manager. I almost exclusively run Wayland since 2022
- Emacs
- Foot = Preferred terminal on Wayland
- Alacritty = For when I need to use X11
- i3-gaps = For older thinkpads, which dont have awesome Wayland support
- lf = A wonderful file manager in Go, second-best after Dired
- Waybar = A bar that I recently began to daily drive since hopping to Hyprland
- Zathura = My pdf-reader of choice
- nvim = The editor setup before I install Emacs

I include the wallpapers I use for both configs; Sway and Hyprland, namely wall, and wall2. 

/*Build with Emacs, and Love. :) krsna*/
